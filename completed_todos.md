  - [X] Layout breaks when pausing for podcast names
  - [X] The queue works but currently does not remove podcasts after switching to a new one

- [x] Occasionally podcasts will put seconds value in mins (This was a bug due to duration parsing. Code fixed, everything now displays properly)

I rebuilt the way this works using async, no problems so far
